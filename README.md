## 🔍 Project Overview

Retail businesses rely heavily on accurate sales predictions to manage inventory, plan marketing, and optimize resources. In this project, I does:

- Cleaned and analyzed historical sales data
- Built forecasting models using:
  - **Facebook Prophet** – for handling seasonality and time series trends
  - **Linear Regression** – for identifying long-term sales patterns
- Visualized model predictions and evaluated their accuracy

## 📌 Task Focus
Perform time series forecasting on retail sales data
- Compare machine learning models for prediction performance
- Visualize sales trends, seasonality, and forecast accuracy
- Gain hands-on experience with Python ML tools

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Python**
- `pandas` – data manipulation  
- `matplotlib` – visualizations  
- `fbprophet` – time series forecasting  
- `scikit-learn` – linear regression modeling  
- `numpy` – numerical operations  


## 📊 Results
- **Prophet** captured weekly/monthly seasonal patterns and offered smooth long-term forecasts.
- **Linear Regression** worked well for identifying linear growth or decline trends.
- Visualizations helped compare model predictions against actual sales.
- Errors were within acceptable range for real-world retail forecasting.
